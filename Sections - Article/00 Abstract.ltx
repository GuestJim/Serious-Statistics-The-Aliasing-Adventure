\section{Abstract}

With this article I attempt to present an accurate and comprehensive explanation of various anti-aliasing technologies currently implemented in video games. 
I started this research for a number of reasons, all related to the writing of this article. 
Though I have been gaming for many years now, my understanding of the methods and technologies involved has been limited, so I wanted to improve it and be able to share what I learned with others. 
When I started my research, I already found the topic interesting, but as I continued to read relevant and related literature, my interest only grew. 
Unfortunately I also found that many of the easier to find and understand explanations of the technologies are oversimplified and occasionally inaccurate, while the scientific papers concerning the technologies, while completely accurate are not so easy to interpret. 
It is my goal for this article that I share accurate and understandable information on this topic I think others are or can be interested in.
