# Serious-Statistics-The-Aliasing-Adventure
The original LaTeX, R, etc. scripts and media used for my Serious Statistics: The Aliasing Adventure article and presentation

It should be noted that either XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX should be used to compile the documents. Depending on the version of the engine, one may be better to use than the other.

This is the original version of the article and presentation (with a couple corrections). To see the newest version, go to the master branch.
