# Serious-Statistics-The-Aliasing-Adventure
The original LaTeX, R, etc. scripts and media used for my Serious Statistics: The Aliasing Adventure article and presentation

It should be noted that either XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX should be used to compile the documents. Depending on the version of the engine, one may be better to use than the other.

Some months after finishing the original draft, I returned to it, making revisions and rebuilding some scripts and graphs too. The original version (with a couple errors corrected) can be found in the 1.0 branch.
