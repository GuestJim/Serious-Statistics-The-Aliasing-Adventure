		\item	The dominant means of sampling \textbf{primitives} for generating computer graphics is \textbf{Rasterization}		
		%\item	The dominant means of generating images from computer graphics \textbf{primitives} is \textbf{Rasterization}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	\textbf{Ray Tracing} is another method that can also suffer from aliasing, and other artifacts
		\end{itemize}

		\item	Rasterization samples a virtual space, creating \textbf{fragments} of the primitives where they are sampled. These fragments are then used for the \textbf{shading} of the final pixel.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	\textbf{Forward} and \textbf{Deferred Shading} act differently with the rasterization step
		\end{itemize}
		\pause
		\item	This sampling can lead to aliasing, depending on if it satisfies the \textbf{Nyquist limit} from Nyquist/Sampling theory

	The \textbf{frustum} is two similar rectangles; the front and back of the camera view
		
	Forward and Deferred shading differ based on when the lighting is calculated
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	Forward calculates the lighting on all fragments, including occluded
		\item	Deferred shading calculates lighting only for non-occluded fragments
	\end{itemize}
	
	Deferred shading can be much faster, by simplifying the lighting calculations but
	
	Forward shading can be more accurate, by knowing edges and transparencies
	
	Additionally, forward shading offers more capabilities and control over lighting
